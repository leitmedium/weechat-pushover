2. Create a new application at https://pushover.net/apps/build
3. Note the "token" for your new application (referenced as TOKEN later on)
4. From the Dashboard at https://pushover.net note your "User key" (referenced as USERKEY later on)
5. Install the pushover app on your iPhone/Android and login
6. put "pushover.py" to ~/.weechat/python
7. start the plugin with "/python load pushover.py"
8. Set user key and token by doing

## Todo

1. Make it configurable to notify about current window or not.
2. Make it configurable to notify only while being in away mode.
3. Make it configurable to send more details (e.g. local timestamp).

## Security

Due to the architecture used, this plugin does not use end-to-end-encryption. It mostly relies on SSL traffic encryption. Check official pushover FAQ for reference: https://pushover.net/faq#security-encryption
